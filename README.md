<b>Name</b>: Janette Julia Koskinen 

<b>Profession</b>: Information Processing Science student, also a radiographer

<b>Location</b>: Oulu

<b>Programming languages</b>: Java, C, Python, SQL
--------

I keep my repositories of C (which isn't yet very confincing even thoguh I have done projects with it) and Python public, but the one with Java is private. If you are interested in seeing it, please don't be afraid to connect me. 

I'm a second year Information Processing Science student from Oulu and I'm interested in software developing and testing, but also cyber security. I try my best to keep my Github up to date with my projects and I'm seeking ideas to improve my skills in programming.
